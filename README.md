# Federal Budget Analysis â€” SQL Project

This project explores U.S. federal budget and spending data through structured SQL analysis using PostgreSQL. The dataset, sourced from [USAspending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/), contains budgetary resources, outlays, obligations, and metadata for agencies, functions, and accounts. The goal of this project is to answer real financial and operational questions and to demonstrate how SQL can be used to uncover inefficiencies, spending behavior, and performance insights.

## Project Overview

Through a series of structured challenges, I investigated:

- Which agencies commit the most federal funding?
- Which programs are overspending relative to their budgets?
- Which accounts are underutilizing their allocated resources?
- How efficiently are departments executing their budgets?

The project includes:

- SQL joins across normalized tables
- Aggregations with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
- Calculated metrics like efficiency ratios and overspend percentages
- Conditional classification using `CASE`
- Cleanly formatted output with accompanying screenshots

## Business Context

Although based on government data, this project mirrors the type of financial analysis done in the private sector: segmenting performance, monitoring utilization, identifying inefficiencies, and ranking cost centers. It simulates the kind of work expected from business analysts, strategy consultants, and financial operations interns.
